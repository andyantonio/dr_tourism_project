## Key Features:

•	Interactive dashboard displaying monthly tourism trends for each country.
•	Visualization of year-over-year changes in tourist visits.
•	Identification of the top countries for visit and year-over-year growth.
•	Six-month forecast of tourist arrivals using SARIMA time series models.

## Methodology:

•	Data cleaning and preprocessing performed in R, automating the retrieval and handling of yearly Excel files.
•	Time series forecasting implemented using SARIMA models, with model selection based on RMSE.
•	Dashboard created in Power BI, presenting key insights on general trends through interactive visualizations.

## Data Source:

•	Data obtained from the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic: https://www.bancentral.gov.do/a/d/2537-sector-turismo

## Key Technologies:
•	R (for data processing and time series analysis)
•	Power BI (for dashboard creation)

## Shortcomings and Improvements:

•	Limitations due to aggregated data; individual-level data would enable more robust analysis.
•	Potential improvements include adding confidence intervals to forecasts and implementing individual models for each country.
•	Automated data retrieval and refresh.
